# Will-Sather

Hello -

Thank you for taking the time to come look at my code and the work I have been putting into my programming experience.  

As of right now, I have committed a Bingo Game Simulator, Keyword Generator project, a COVID-19 Windows application demo, a group project from a Hackathon, a bus/transit simulator, and finally a website.  

### Web Server (C)

During my fall semester of my junior year, I was in a Introduction to Operating Systems class at University of Minnesota. This class was focused on the low-level intricacies of a machine's operating system.  This is one project of two projects all semester in which we built a functional web server.  This server was able to process GET requests and return a variety of images that were being hosted on the computer.  This allowed us to not only learn the basics on socket programming, but also have a working, templated out web server that we can base future projects on.  


### COVID-19 Demo (C#)

The COVID-19 Windows application demo is one of my more recent project which I built out of boredom during my quarantined semester.  In the directory, I have two different versions.  The first one was my first ever project using C# and visual studio.  After 6 months of enterprise C# development (internship and part time work), I decided to redo some of the core functionality.  Some of the benefits of the second version is a massive runtime improvement, implemented a API consumption using JSON, and just overall better file management and code health.  This project has been an ongoing one and I will continue to upgrade it as I have the time.  I am now working on implementing feature to change specified state, asynchonrous loading with UI toggles, and overall a cleaner more usable user interface that meets Microsoft's standards.  I will continue to keep each version of this demo on git as to show my overall improvements and code growth.  

### Bus Simulator (C++)

During my spring semester of sophomore year, I took a class called Software Design and Development. This class is entirely centered around learning C++ and applying it to a single, semester-long, project.  This project is a simulation of the university's transit bus system.  The goal of this project is to learn various programming paradigms and styles, proper documentation skills, and understanding the raw C++  along with forming a software development mentality (rather just than coding). 

### MinneHack 2020 (Java)

During my fall semester of sophomore year, I went out on a limb with some friends and joined a 24 hour coding competition.  On a saturday night, we were "locked" into the student union and were designated to use some form of coding to solve a problem.  The problem was "a solution that ables people to give back to society or the community".  Although we didn't come up with a fully functioning product at the end of 24 hours, we still partcipated and managed to have some form of code to submit at the end.  Nothing has ever come from it yet, but we can look back today and admire how much we have improved as coders and software engineers.     

### Google Ads Keyword Generator (Python)

The Google Ads Keyword Generator was written and utilized during my time as Creatively Innovative, a digital marketing and data analytics agency in Chanhassen, MN.  I wrote this code to be able to save a consistent amount of time and busy work.  During the onboarding process for our clients, we would build out custom keywords for different campaigns and ad groups.  This project made it easier to generate long-tail keywords that included personalized city names and states.  At the end of the day, this was intended to be a quick fix to a problem at work, but I feel is a good example of my coding style and an example of some Python programming

### Website (React / HTML)

Finally, the last thing committed on here is my personal websites / resume.  I have two, a version 1 built strictly on HTML and a version 2 that was redesign in React.  Included is the raw source code - these have just been fun projects for me to work on. If you want to view the hosted version, it is available at https://sather.ws and https://old.sather.ws

Thanks for spending the time to look and review this!

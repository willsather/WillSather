# Will-Sather

Hello -

Thank you for taking the time to come look at my code and the work I have been putting into my programming experience.  

As of right now, I have committed a COVID-19 Windows application demo, a bus/transit simulator, a C seb server, and finally a website. 

### Web Server (C)

During my fall semester of my junior year, I was in a Introduction to Operating Systems class at University of Minnesota. This class was focused on the low-level intricacies of a machine's operating system.  This is one project of two projects all semester in which we built a functional web server.  This server was able to process GET requests and return a variety of images that were being hosted on the computer.  This allowed us to not only learn the basics on socket programming, but also have a working, templated out web server that we can base future projects on.  


### COVID-19 Demo (C#)

The COVID-19 Windows application demo is one of my more recent project which I built out of boredom during my quarantined semester.  In the directory, I have two different versions.  The first one was my first ever project using C# and visual studio.  After 6 months of enterprise C# development (internship and part time work), I decided to redo some of the core functionality.  Some of the benefits of the second version is a massive runtime improvement, implemented a API consumption using JSON, and just overall better file management and code health.  This project has been an ongoing one and I will continue to upgrade it as I have the time.  I am now working on implementing feature to change specified state, asynchonrous loading with UI toggles, and overall a cleaner more usable user interface that meets Microsoft's standards.  I will continue to keep each version of this demo on git as to show my overall improvements and code growth.  

### Bus Simulator (C++)

During my spring semester of sophomore year, I took a class called Software Design and Development. This class is entirely centered around learning C++ and applying it to a single, semester-long, project.  This project is a simulation of the university's transit bus system.  The goal of this project is to learn various programming paradigms and styles, proper documentation skills, and understanding the raw C++  along with forming a software development mentality (rather just than coding). 

### React Website (React / HTML)

Finally, the last thing committed on here is my personal websites / resume.  I have two, a version 1 built strictly on HTML and a version 2 that was redesign in React.  Included is the raw source code - these have just been fun projects for me to work on. If you want to view the hosted version, it is available at https://sather.ws and https://old.sather.ws

Thanks for spending the time to look and review this!

byt8 is my first iOS app that is published on the App Store.  This project arose from so many of my friends and family struggling to have a productive, meaningful day throughout quarantine and now working remotely.  I personally never journal or use any journaling apps; however, every night before bed find the time to scroll through instagram or twitter for a few minutes.  This is where byt8 came to life -- every day, the app prompts 8 binary, yes/no styled questions designed to help you easily reflect on the day, while it automatically collects weather data and HealthKit activity data.

## Bus Simulator 
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-ff69b4)

During my spring semester of sophomore year, I took a class called Software Design and Development. This class is entirely centered around learning C++ and applying it to a single, semester-long, project.  This project is a simulation of the university's transit bus system.  The goal of this project is to learn various programming skills and styles, proper documentation skills, and understanding the raw C++ skills necessary for a fast and functioning web application along with forming a software development mentality using various project management paradigms.

## COVID-19 Analytics

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-blueviolet)

The COVID-19 Windows application demo is one of my more recent project which I built out of boredom during my quarantined semester.  In the directory, I have two different versions.  The first one was my first ever project using C# and visual studio.  After 6 months of enterprise C# development (internship and part time work), I decided to redo some of the core functionality.  Some of the benefits of the second version is a massive runtime improvement, implemented a API consumption using JSON, and just overall better file management and code health.  This project has been an ongoing one and I will continue to upgrade it as I have the time.  I am now working on implementing feature to change specified state, asynchonrous loading with UI toggles, and overall a cleaner more usable user interface that meets Microsoft's standards.  I will continue to keep each version of this demo on git as to show my overall improvements and code growth.

Finally, the last thing committed on here is my personal websites / resume.  I have two, a version 1 built strictly on HTML and a version 2 that was redesign in React.  Included is the raw source code - these have just been fun projects for me to work on. If you want to view the hosted React version, it is available at https://sather.ws.  I also have done some experimenting with Docker so you can explore the container images at [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/willsather/website).

## Web Server

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C-red)

During my fall semester of my junior year, I was in a Introduction to Operating Systems class at University of Minnesota. This class was focused on the low-level intricacies of a machine's operating system.  This is one project of two projects all semester in which we built a functional web server.  This server was able to process GET requests and return a variety of images that were being hosted on the computer.  This allowed us to not only learn the basics on socket programming, but also have a working, templated out web server that we can base future projects on.

Thanks for spending the time to look this over!
